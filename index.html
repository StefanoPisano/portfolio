    <h1 class="title">Hello!<br/></h1>
    <p class="subtitle">My name is <span class="name">Stefano</span></p>

    <p>
        I am an italian <span class="accent">software developer</span> based in Milan.<br/>
        I strongly believe in good practices and team working.
    </p>

    <p>
        My passion for software development dates back to my childhood, when I would spend hours tinkering with CSS and HTML to create unique themes for an online forum.
        This love propelled me towards a career in software development, which I officially began in 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
        I thrive in an environment where teamwork is appreciated and encouraged.
        Collaborating with others to exchange ideas, knowledge and even unwind with a refreshing beer, is what makes work meaningful and enjoyable to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        While writing code I always try to apply some magic tricks which will transform bad code into clean code.<br/>
        My passion lies in keeping things simple.
